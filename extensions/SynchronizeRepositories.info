description: This module contains code to synchronize the documents in two different repositories.  It compares the bits of the originals to see if two folders are the same.  This means that it won't detect differences in metadata (which is what you want, if you think about it).  It contains the following functions:                       <p><b>synchronize</b>:  This function takes no parameters.  It brings up a Web form, which allows you to specify the URL and password for the remote repository with which you are synchronizing.  It will then display a list of the differences between the two repositories, and ask you what to do.  You can either push items from this repository to the other one, pull items from the remote repository to this one, or do both.                       <p><b>push</b>:  For those who don't want to use <b>synchronize</b>, this allows you to push all documents which aren't already in the other repository to it.  It takes two arguments, <i>repository</i>, the URL of the other repository, and <i>password</i>, the password for the other repository.                       <p><b>pull</b>:  For those who don't want to use <b>synchronize</b>, this allows you to pull all documents which aren't already in this repository but are in the other repository, from the other repository.  It takes two arguments, <i>repository</i>, the URL of the other repository, and <i>password</i>, the password for the other repository.                       <p><b>sync</b>:  For those who don't want to use <b>synchronize</b>, this function will synchronize the collections in the two repositories.  It takes two arguments, <i>repository</i>, the URL of the other repository, and <i>password</i>, the password for the other repository.    <i>2.2 fixes a typo that crept into 2.1.</i>          <p><i>2.3</i> updates actions to also synchronize the <tt>links</tt> directory and <tt>paragraphs.txt</tt> file.
