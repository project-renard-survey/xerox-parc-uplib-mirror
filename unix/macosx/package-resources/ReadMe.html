<!-- This is UpLib, a personal document library system from the Palo
Alto Research Center (PARC). -->
<!-- This document is written in reStructuredText, which is why it looks
a bit wierd to you.  See http://docutils.sourceforge.net/. -->
<p>UpLib is a system from the <a class="reference" href="http://www.parc.com/">Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)</a> for
maintaining and using a collection of documents in digital form.  It's
focussed on the representation and manipulation of those documents in
&quot;virtual paper&quot; form, regardless of the original form of the document
-- scanned, PDF, Microsoft Word, HTML, digital photos, etc.  That is,
each document is represented as a stack of sheets of virtual paper.
These sheets can be individually manipulated, or treated as a group,
just like a paper document.  The documents are full-text indexed, and
metadata optionally associated with a document can also be indexed.</p>
<p>UpLib consists of two major parts, the &quot;guardian angel&quot; (a custom Web
server), and a small collection of command-line programs that can be
used to simplify some operations.  The basic idea is that the angel
runs as a daemon, giving access to the documents in the repository,
and the user accesses the repository through a web browser.  New
documents can be added to the repository by uploading them from a Web
browser, but the utility program <tt class="literal"><span class="pre">uplib-add-document</span></tt> simplifies the
process, and adds the ability to convert documents from PDF format.
For security, all communication between the browser and the angel is
done over SSL encrypted communication paths, and the repository itself
may optionally be password-protected.</p>
