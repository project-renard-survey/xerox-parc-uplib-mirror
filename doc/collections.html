<P>
UpLib supports collections of documents.  Currently, the user interface only allows you to make <i>query collections</i>, which are sets of document corresponding to the results of some search.  This search is re-run whenever you call for the collection, so these collections are dynamic, in that they may include documents added to the repository after the collection was created.
<p>
<b>Saving a query.</b><br>To create a query collection, simply type in a query at the top of the Web page.  If the results are not quite what you want, edit the query and try again.  When you have the right collection of documents, go to the bottom of the results page, and save the search by giving it a particular name.  This will become a named collection.
<p>
<b>Showing a collection.</b><br>The toolbar at the top of the standard UpLib Web page gives you a pulldown menu that allows quick access to any of your query collections.  In addition, it contains two control selections, "(All Documents)", and "(Edit Collections)".  "(All Documents)" will simply show you the documents in the repository; it's the same as saying, "no collection".  Selecting "(Edit Collections)" will take you to a collections manager that allows you to rename or delete query collections.
