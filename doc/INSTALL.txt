   It's written in something called "reStructuredText", which makes it seem a bit
   odd, if you're looking at the plain text.

================
Installing UpLib
================

The guardian angel (see the README) and two command-line programs,
``uplib-make-repository`` and ``uplib-check-angel``, make up the
"server" side of the system, and the other command-line programs,
``uplib-add-document`` and ``uplib-get-document``, makes up the
"client" side of the system.  Both client and server programs are
highly portable; they run on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.

To build UpLib on your system, you should first make sure you have
installed the various prerequisite packages for the system.  See the
doc/REQUIREMENTS.txt file for specific packages; note that there are
different (but not mutually exclusive) requirements for the
server-side and client-side parts of the system.  There's an HTML
version of REQUIREMENTS at doc/requirements.html, if you prefer to
read it that way

If you are installing on Windows, you should now switch to reading the
doc/WINDOWS.txt file, which explains how to build UpLib on Windows.
If you are using a Unix system (Linux, MacOS X, etc.), continue with
this description.

Once the prerequisites are available, you can build UpLib with the
normal autoconf configure process::

  % mkdir /tmp/uplib	# or wherever you build
  % tar xvfz uplib-<version>.tar.gz
  % ./configure --with-lucene=/usr/lib/lucene-1.3.jar
  [ ...various configure output omitted... ]
  % make
  % make install

By default, installation will be under /usr; you can use the ``--prefix``
and ``--exec-prefix`` options with configure to modify this.  You can run
"./configure --help" to get a list of the other configuration options.
You *must* use the ``--with-lucene`` command switch to specify the location
of the Lucene library.

If you want to use a different version of the ``pdftotext`` program
(for instance, one that supports the ``-wordboxes`` switch), you can specify the
full path to this program with the special configuration switch
``--with-pdftotext=PATH``, where ``PATH`` is the full path of that program.

When giving the ``uplib-check-angel`` command, remember to provide the
full path name of your repository.

Once you've installed the code, use the command-line program
``uplib-make-repository`` to create a repository and start an angel
for it.  Once the angel is running, try connecting to it with a
browser.  Remember to use an ``https:`` URL for it, as in
``https://mymachine:8090/``, if ``mymachine`` is the machine you're
running it on, and ``8090`` is the port you selected for it.  See the
file doc/USAGE.txt for more explicit instructions.

For information on extending UpLib for your own purposes, see the file EXTENDING.
