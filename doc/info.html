<P><B>Searching</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>UpLib search is based on the <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/docs/index.html">Lucene full-text search engine</A> from the <A HREF="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</A> project.  When you run a search, it selects the set of documents matching that search, and shows them to you.
<p>A simple way to search is to type in a word or two, then hit return.  The search engine will look for any documents that have any of those words in any of their fields, and return them, ranked according to an arcane scoring system which tries to put the documents best satisfying the search at the beginning.

<P><B>Collections</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>UpLib supports collections of documents.  Currently, the user interface only allows you to make <i>query collections</i>, which are sets of document corresponding to the results of some search.  This search is re-run whenever you call for the collection, so these collections are dynamic, in that they may include documents added to the repository after the collection was created.

<P><B>Extensions</B><BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>The UpLib system can be changed by adding modules of code called <i>extensions</i> to repositories.  An extension can modify existing functionality or add new functionality.  Extensions are written in the <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a> programming language.  There are two basic classes of extensions:  <i>initializers</i>, which change or augment the underlying automatic functionality of the repository, and <i>actions</i>, which add functions to be explicitly invoked by a client of the repository service.
