.. instructions for installing UpLib on Windows.

   It's written in something called "reStructuredText", which makes it seem a bit
   odd, if you're looking at the plain text.

=====================================
Building UpLib from Source on Windows
=====================================

1) First, download and install, from ftp://gd.tuwien.ac.at/gnu/mingw/,
   the three installers:  MinGW-5.1.3.exe, MSYS-1.0.10.exe, and
   msysDTK-1.0.1.exe (you'll have to look for it in the list of
   downloads).  Run them in that order.  When the MinGW installer
   asks, go for a FULL install, not the default MINIMAL one.  The MSYS
   installer will pop up a CMD.EXE window that will ask you if you
   want to "normalize" the install.  Say "yes", and when it asks where
   the MinGW install is, say "c:/MinGW".  After it finishes with the
   CMD.EXE window, it will open some RTF documents; just close them
   and continue on to install msysDTK-1.0.1.exe.

   Once you have installed all three, you will have a Start folder called MinGW, and in it
   another folder called "MSYS", and in it a program called "msys".  Select that program
   and run it; it will start up an rxvt window running a Bourne shell.  You can now go and
   use "configure" and "make" as you would on a UNIX platform.

2)  To run a service (the UpLib Guardian Angel) as yourself on Windows,
    you must add the "Log on as a service" right to your user account.
    To do this on Windows XP, perform the following steps:

    1) From the "Start" button, choose "Settings", and open "Control Panel".
    2) Open "Administrative Tools".
    3) Open "Local Security Policy".
    4) Open "Local Policies".
    5) Open "User Rights Assignment".
    6) Double-click "Log on as a service".
    7) If your account is not shown as one of the accounts with this
       privilege, press the "Add User or Group" button.
    8) Type <domain>\<username>, where <domain> is your domain (just "." if
       you just want to use a local login), and <username> is your username
       in that domain.
    9) Click OK.

3)  Build xpdf-3.02pl3 from sources, if you haven't already.  Unpack it, then apply the
    ``xpdf-3.02-PATCH`` file from the UpLib tar file, using "patch".  Then "configure"
    it and "make" it.  Use the "--enable-wordlist" and "--without-x" options to
    "configure".

4)  Next, you need to install all the other packages listed in the
    REQUIREMENTS_ document.  Make sure that pythonservice.exe is
    installed; some users have reported missing that step by accident.
    See the end of this document for more comments by an UpLib user on
    installing some of those packages.  Set up your ``PATH`` environment variable
    so that the binaries directory for each of these packages is on it.

5)  Choose a directory to unpack the UpLib code into.  It shouldn't
    have any spaces in the pathname, so using a subdirectory of
    ``C:\Documents and Settings\`` (like your home directory) isn't a
    good idea.  (This is due to an issue with ``gcc`` which may be
    fixed in a future release.)  Similarly, the directory you're
    installing UpLib to, on this machine, should not have a space
    anywhere in the pathname.  If you *are* using a directory with spaces in the name,
    make sure you use the 8.3 names for the folders on the path (see #6 for more information on this).

6)  Unpack the UpLib tar file (or check it out from CVS) and configure it.  If you checked it out from CVS,
    you need to run the command "autoconf" to generate the "configure" script before invoking that script.
    When specifying the installation location with
    the "--prefix" option, you should use MinGW 8.3 notation for directory names.  For instance, in
    MinGW 8.3 notation, the directory ``C:\Program Files\UpLib`` (which is where the standard UpLib installer
    for Windows would put it) would be specified as
    ``/c/PROGRA~1/UpLib``, and ``C:\Documents and Settings\username\test`` would be
    ``/c/DOCUME~1/username/test``.

7)  Type "make" to build the system, and "make install" to install it.

8)  You should now be able to run ``uplib-add-document``, ``uplib-portal``, and
    ``uplib-get-document``.  You may want to add the "bin" subdirectory of
    the directory where you installed UpLib to your ``Path`` environment
    variable.
