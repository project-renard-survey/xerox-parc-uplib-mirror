.. A description of various important metadata fields

   It's written in something called "reStructuredText", which makes it seem a bit
   odd, if you're looking at the plain text.

Document Metadata
=================

Each document folder contains a file called metadata.txt.  The format
of this file is defined in the ARCHITECTURE document, but it's
basically lines of text, each line containing a field name and a
string value for that field.  This section describes the contents and
use of some of those fields.

page-numbers For documents that don't use decimal numbering, don't
        start on page one, or don't have standard sequential page
        numbers, this field allows a more flexible assignment of page
        numbers to pages.  It consists of a sequence of
        semicolon-separated fields, where each field consists of three
        comma-separated subfields.  For each field, the three
        subfields contain, in order, a page-number-type code, a
        first-page number, and a page index or page index range.  The
        page-number-type code is either "d", for decimal page numbers,
        "b", for blank (no page numbers), or "r", for roman numeral
        page numbers.  The first-page number is the number that should
        be used for the first page in this sequence; subsequent pages
        will have monotonically increasing page numbers.  Decimal page
        numbers should be used for both decimal and roman page spans.
        For the "b" (blank) number-type code, this field may be
        ommitted, but the commas separating it from the first and
        third fields must still be present.  The page index or page
        range index may be either a single number, giving the
        zero-based index of the page to label, or two page numbers
        separated with a hyphen character, giving a range of pages to
        label.  When a range is specified, both the first page index
        given and the last one given should be in that range.
