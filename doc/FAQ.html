<LI><b><i>I added a few documents to my UpLib, but they don't appear in my
repository; instead, I found them in a directory called "pending".  Do
you know why this is happening?</i></b>
<blockquote>
Newly submitted documents are placed in the "pending" folder while document
rippers are run on them.  Depending on what rippers you are running,
this can take a minute or two.  When the rippers are finished, the
document is moved from pending to the "docs" subdirectory, and is then
visible via the Web interface.

<LI><b><i>
When I put a document in my UpLib repository, it takes forever!  The 'uplib-add-document' program seems to hang and hang, and then when it finishes, the documents aren't in my UpLib.  What's happening?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
When you submit a PDF file to the uplib-add-document program (or drop it on the UpLib droplet),
this program does two things which can take a long time if your PDF file is fairly long.
First, it creates a multi-page TIFF version of the document, and optimizes storage used for the pages by looking at the colors in each page to see if it can be stored in a more efficient compression form without loosing any image quality.  This can take up to 15 seconds per page on a slow machine.  Secondly, it attempts to find the text in the PDF file, sometimes by using OCR on each page.  Again, if the document is quite large, this can take a few minutes.
<P>Once this program finishes, the document has been uploaded to the repository.
The repository puts new documents in a "pending" folder while document
rippers are run on them.  Depending on what rippers you are running,
this can take a minute or two.  When the rippers are finished, the
document is moved from pending to the "docs" subdirectory, and is then
visible via the Web interface.

So how can I tell what's going on with the guardian angel?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
The angel will write debugging output to a log file.  If you go to the directory where your repository is, you'll see a subdirectory called <tt>overhead</tt>.  In that subdirectory, there will be a file called <tt>angel.log</tt>.  You can look at the end of that file, to see log messages written recently.
<p>If you are using Unix (or Linux or Mac OS X or Solaris), you can watch the file and see new messages as they are added to it, with a standard tool called <i>tail</i>.  Just type <tt>tail -f <i>logfile</i></tt>, where <tt><i>logfile</i></tt> is the full path to <tt>angel.log</tt>.  Perhaps there's a similar utility on machines running Windows.

I put "assume-no-password: true" in my <tt>~/.uplibrc</tt> file, but uplib-add-document still prompts for a password!  How can I make it stop?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
This is usually because the <tt>~/.uplibrc</tt> file doesn't contain a section header, or the "assume-no-password" option is in a section that isn't being used for that machine.  There should always be a section header for the default section at the beginning of the configuration file.  This is a line which just contains the string "[default]".  If you put the "assume-no-password" option in this section, it will be used, unless overridden by a more specific section.
<p>The other problem that may cause this symptom is having two (or more!) "assume-no-password" lines with differing values in the same section.  There should be only one.
</blockquote></li>

<LI><b><i>
I put a password on my UpLib repository, and now I've forgotten it and can't connect to the UpLib server.  How do I fix things?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
You can't find out what the password is, but you can remove it manually.  First, stop the repository's guardian angel with the command<p><tt>uplib-check-angel --stop <i>DIRECTORY</i></tt><p>where <i>DIRECTORY</i> is the directory the repository is in.  Then go to the directory where the repository is.  There's a subdirectory called "overhead" there.  Go to that subdirectory.  You'll see a file called "metadata.txt".  Open that file with a text editor.  You'll see a line that begins with "password-hash", and contains a long hexadecimal number.  Delete that line, and save the modified metadata.txt file.  Now restart your repository's guardian angel with the command<p><tt>uplib-check-angel <i>DIRECTORY</i></tt><p>Your repository will now have no password, and you can assign a new one to it.

<LI><b><i>
Can I use Python 2.4 or 2.5 instead of Python 2.3?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
Yes, that seems to work fine.  In fact, 2.4 is probably preferable.
</blockquote></li>
<!-- ****************************************************** -->
<LI><b><i>
If I try to use <tt>uplib-add-document</tt> on an HTML file, or drop an HTML file on the Portal, I'm told that it "can't find a parser for this document".  What does this mean?  Doesn't HTML work in UpLib?  Why not?
</b></i> <blockquote>HTML is a markup syntax, not a document format.
To form an effective document, HTML files must be arranged in a
certain proximity to image files, CSS files, Javascript files, and
various other things it might include.  HTML is designed to be served
from a Web server.  UpLib can handle HTML that is specified in the
form of an HTTP URL, and which can be pulled from a Web server along
with its other data files.  It can also handle HTML in the form of a
Mozilla"Web
Page Complete" document, in which the HTML file is stored along with
all of its ancillary data in a specified format.

<LI><b><i>
How can I remove an UpLib repository that I created for testing, or by accident?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
First, use the UpLib Janitor, or <tt>uplib-check-angel</tt>, to stop the repository's angel.  Then
simply delete the repository's directory.  The Janitor will show that the directory has
disappeared.  If you then restart the Janitor, the repository will no longer be shown.

When I'm using IE on Windows, whenever I switch from one document to another, IE gives me a dialog box, saying that the page "contains both secure and insecure content", and I have to click a confirm box to accept it.  What makes that happen, and how do I get rid of it?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
Well, we'd <b>really</b> like to know just what IE is complaining about, so if you can figure it out, tell us!
<p>Meanwhile, Eric Bier figured out the following:<br><i>
<blockquote>
I poked around on the Web a little bit and found a fix to this problem.  In
the IE preferences there is an option "Display mixed content?"  The options
are disable, enable, and prompt.  The default is prompt.  Enable does the
trick.
</blockquote></i>
Bill Janssen suggests a different workaround:<br><i>
<blockquote>
IE is buggy.  Don't use it.  Try Firefox or Safari or Opera instead.

Why is the login panel that bright shade of red?
</b></i>
<blockquote>
It's not red, it's orange.
<p>When I started at PARC, many of the hallways and the inside of the elevators were approximately that shade of bright orange.  I was told that when George Pake started PARC, he'd read some research claiming that the color orange stimulated creativity.  So he used plenty of it around the building.  Whenever I came in and saw that color, it reminded me of the optimism and determination Pake used to establish PARC.  I use it here to honor that spirit.  -- wcj
