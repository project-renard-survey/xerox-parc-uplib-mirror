============
Introduction
============

UpLib is a system from the `Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)`_ for
archiving and using a collection of documents in digital form.  It's
focussed on the representation and manipulation of those documents in
"virtual paper" form, regardless of the original form of the document
-- scanned, PDF, Microsoft Word, HTML, digital photos, etc.  Each
document is represented as a stack of sheets of virtual paper.  These
sheets can be individually manipulated, or treated as a group, just
like a paper document.  The documents are also full-text indexed for
search and retrieval, and metadata values optionally associated with a
document can also be indexed.

UpLib consists of two major parts, the "guardian angel" (a custom Web
server), and a small collection of command-line programs that can be
used to simplify some operations.  The basic idea is that the angel
runs as a daemon, giving access to the documents in the repository,
and the user accesses the repository through a web browser.  New
documents can be added to the repository by uploading them from a Web
browser, but the utility program ``uplib-add-document`` simplifies the
process, and adds the ability to convert documents from PDF format.
For security, all communication between the browser and the angel is
done over SSL encrypted communication paths, and the repository itself
may optionally be password-protected.
